## Problems & Solutions

- Had some issues with installing pip on my machine. Mostly because I was trying to use python2 to run python3. #Was able to install it all using a script file `get-pip.py` and that got it running. Also had to update the pathing to run pip since it wasn't installed in the proper directory (I'm using WSL so there are some issues there)
- It's `yield`, not `yeild`
